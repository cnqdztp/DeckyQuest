Turn your Elgato Stream Deck into a retro gaming device! This prototype demonstrates how to repurpose the Stream Deck's 5x3 LCD button grid into a playable dot-matrix game interface using Unity. üïπÔ∏è

A proof-of-concept that bridges the Elgato Stream Deck (typically used by streamers for scene controls) with Unity game development to create dot-matrix  games. The prototype includes:

- Integration of the Stream Deck SDK with Unity via C# scripting

- Custom input handling and dynamic LCD button visualization

- A 30s  game prototype

It's a fun side-project, with the purpose of showing how everyday hardware can be reimagined for creative purposes!
